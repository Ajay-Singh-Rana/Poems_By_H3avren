<pre align="center">
The day you fall,
I'll walk you home,
No matter what,
I'll walk you home.
I'll sit by your side,
In the night's armour.
I'll guard your pride,
Under the sun's glamour.

The day you fall,
I'll walk you home.
No matter what,
I'll walk you home.

The day i fall,
I wanna see you there.
If my wounds bledd,
I want you to care.
If i'am feeling cold,
Bring me something to wear.
If i'am passing out,
Gimme your final stare.

I wanna walk you home,
I wanna call you home.
I wanna stay at you,
Until you can walk alone.
